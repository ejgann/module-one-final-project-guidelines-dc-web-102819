Beat It! is a playlist-generating application that identifies and collects songs based on the songs' beats per minute (BPM). 

How It Works
Users specify an exercise activity, such as walking, running, or higher-intensity exercises. Each of these exercise categories have pre-set ranges of BPMs assigned to them. The application retrieves songs within that specific range of BPMs and creates a playlist that the user can name.

For example, if the user identified their desired exercise activity as a steady-pace run, the application identifies this activity has having a BPM range of 150-160. A playlist is returned that contains songs with BPMs that fall within that range.
